To pass the box model of parent to children, set box-sizing property to inherit, 
    which will tell the targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.

The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, 
    while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. 
    These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.


To create the black keys, add a new .key.black--key::after selector. 
    This will target the elements with the class key black--key, and select the pseudo-element after
    these elements in the HTML.

In the new selector, set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "". 
    This will make the pseudo-elements empty.

The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, 
    the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and 
    the elements will not be rendered to the page. Setting the content property to an empty string 
    "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. 
    Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.

Logical operators can be used to construct more complex media queries. The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.

For example, a media query that targets a display width between 500px and 1000px would be:

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){

}
