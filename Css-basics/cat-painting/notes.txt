CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned in the browser. 
    It has a position property you can set to static, absolute, relative, sticky or fixed.

    ---Once you set the position property of the element, you can move the element around by 
    setting a pixel or a percentage value for one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.

    ----static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element, you won't be 
    able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom.

    ---When you use the relative value, the element is still positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
    but the top, left, bottom, and right values become active.

    ---When you use the absolute value for your position property, the element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, and then its position is 
    determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

    ----fixed is a position property value that lets you make an element fixed to the page no 
    matter where the user scrolls to on the page.

    ----sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It allows an element to stick to a specific position within its containing element 
    or viewport, based on the scroll position.

To center an element by positioning :  element's position property set to absolute. 
    Set a value of 0 for the right, left, top, bottom properties, 
    then set its margin property on all sides to auto.

The transform property allows you to modify the shape, position, and size of an element without changing the layout or affecting the surrounding elements. 
    It has functions such as translate(), rotate(), scale(), skew(), and matrix()

z-index is a property you can use to define the order of overlapping HTML elements.
     Any element with a higher z-index will always be positioned over an element with a lower z-index.
